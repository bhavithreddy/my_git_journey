## Overview

Python is a high-level, easy-to-learn programming language that is ideal for scripting and rapid application development. Its elegant syntax, dynamic typing, and interpreted nature make it a versatile language for various platforms.

## Features

*   Efficient high-level data structures
*   Simple but effective object-oriented programming approach
*   Extensive standard library
*   Easily extendable with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++
*   Suitable as an extension language for customizable applications

## Installation

To install Python, download the latest version from the official Python website: <https://www.python.org/>

## Usage

1.  Invoke the Python interpreter using the command `python` (or `python3` depending on your system).
2.  Use the interactive mode to experiment with Python code.
3.  Write and run Python scripts using the `python` command.

## Documentation

*   The Python Language Reference provides a formal definition of the language.
