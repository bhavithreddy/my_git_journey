# Python Tutorial
## Overview
The Python Tutorial is a comprehensive guide to the Python programming language. It covers the basic concepts and features of Python, including data structures, object-oriented programming, and scripting.

## Features
* Easy to learn and powerful programming language
* Efficient high-level data structures
* Simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming
* Elegant syntax and dynamic typing
* Interpreted nature makes it ideal for scripting and rapid application development

## Installation
To get started with Python, you can download the latest version from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/. The Python interpreter and extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms.

## Usage
The Python interpreter can be extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++. It is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

### Example Code
```python
# Using Python as a calculator
print(2 + 2)  # Output: 4

# Using Python as a calculator with variables
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Output: 8
```

## Documentation
The Python Tutorial is divided into several sections, including:
* Whetting Your Appetite: An introduction to Python and its features
