# Python Tutorial
## Overview
The Python Tutorial is an introductory guide to the Python programming language. It covers the basic concepts and features of Python, including data structures, object-oriented programming, and control flow tools.

## Features
* Easy to learn and powerful programming language
* Efficient high-level data structures
* Simple and effective approach to object-oriented programming
* Elegant syntax and dynamic typing
* Ideal for scripting and rapid application development

## Installation
To get started with Python, you can download the latest version from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/. The Python interpreter and standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms.

## Usage
The Python interpreter can be extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++. It is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications. The tutorial introduces the reader to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system, including:
* Using Python as a calculator
* First steps towards programming
* Control flow tools (if statements, for statements, etc.)
* Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries)
* Modules and packages
* Input and output
* Errors and exceptions
* Classes and objects

## Documentation
The Python Language Reference provides a more formal definition of the language. Additional resources include:
* The Python Standard Library
* Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter
* Python/C API Reference Manual
* Glossary

## Contributing
To contribute to the Python project, you can start by reading the documentation and exploring the code. You can also join the Python community and participate in discussions on the official Python forums.

## License
The Python software is licensed under the PSF License, which is a permissive free software license.

## Example Code
```python
# Using Python as a calculator
print(2 + 2)  # Output: 4

# First steps towards programming
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Output: 8

# Control flow tools
if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to y")

# Data structures
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Output: apple

# Modules and packages
import math
print(math.pi)  # Output: 3.14159265359
```
